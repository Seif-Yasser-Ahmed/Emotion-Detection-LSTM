# Emotion-Detection-LSTM
This notebook showcases an Emotion Detection model using LSTM in TensorFlow, trained on the [ISEAR dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalsanto007/isear-dataset). It processes text to classify emotions like joy, anger, and sadness. The model uses embedding layers and LSTM units to capture text dependencies and evaluates accuracy and loss, offering insights into emotion recognition performance.
